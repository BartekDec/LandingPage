                    <h4> Dji Phantom 4 Pro</h4>
                    <p > DJI Phantom 4 Pro, released in November 2016, has a three-axis stabilized camera with a 1-inch 20 MP CMOS sensor. It upgrades its obstacle avoidance with five directional sensors. The Phantom 4 Pro offers two remote controllers, one with a dedicated screen (Phantom 4 Pro+) and one without. It integrates an upgraded Lightbridge HD video transmission system that adds 5.8 GHz transmission support and a maximum downlink video transmission range of 7 km. In addition - DJI released a set of Goggles, which can be used with various DJI equipment, including the Phantom 4 Pro, to allow First Person View (FPV) flying </p>

                    <p > Released in May 2017, the Spark  was designed to be an affordable consumer drone that is nevertheless capable of producing high-quality images and video. This drone is DJI's cheapest to date and features a 12-megapixel camera capable of shooting 1080p video at 30fps. The camera is stabilised mechanically by a 2-axis gimbal. The Spark also carries an advanced infrared 3D camera that helps the drone to detect obstacles in front of it, as well as facilitating hand-gesture controlâ€”a feature that was, until the release of the Mavic Air in January 2018, unique to the Spark. In addition to a smartphone app with virtual controller, a physical controller can also be bought, extending the drone's range up to 1.2 miles (2 km). The aircraft has a flight duration of up to 16 minutes, but its exhausted battery can easily be swapped out for a charged battery to extend flight time.
                        There have been multiple complaints that the drone could switch off and fall while flying. DJI responded to this by releasing a mandatory battery firmware update in August 2017</p>

                    <h4> Dji Mavic Pro</h4> 
                    <p> The Mavic will fold small enough to fit into a small bag (83mm x 83mm x 198mm). Its legs and propellers fold underneath and to the side of the drone to form a compact package. The Mavic is equipped with the same camera as the Phantom 4 UAV. The camera is a 12MP camera that is capable of shooting 4K videos at 24 frames per second (FPS). It is capable of 96 FPS when shooting in 1080p. Its camera keeps the same 60Mbit/s bitrate seen in the Phantom 4. The lens in the DJI Mavic possesses a 78-degree field of view (FOV), whereas the Phantom 4 maintains a 94-degree FOV. The Mavic flies at a top speed of 65 km/h (40 miles per hour (mph)) in sport mode. An improved Lightbridge system can livestream video at a distance of 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) in 1080p.</p>
